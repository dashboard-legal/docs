Organization Owners and Admins can manage the security settings for their organization in the [security settings page](https://app.dashboardlegal.com/x/settings/security/).

> To learn mobe about the difference between Owners, Admins, and Members, please read the [User Roles](../administration/managing-users/#user-roles) guide.

## Multi-Factor Authentication
MFA is a security feature which ensures the user's identity by requiring them to not just enter their username/password combination, but also verify with a one-time password via their mobile device every time they log in.

Any user can set up MFA on their own account by visiting their [account security page](https://app.dashboardlegal.com/x/account/security/).

As an organization Owner/Admin, you may enforce MFA on your users by changing the setting in the [security settings page](https://app.dashboardlegal.com/x/settings/security/). You may require it for all of your users, or just Owners/Admins.

When MFA is enforced for an organization, new users will be prompted the configure it right after registering. If MFA is enforced for a user, they may not disable it from their account settings.
