description: Your sensitive data is hosted securely in systems you trust

Information security is of upmost importance to Dashboard Legal.

We take extra precaution to only store your data if we absolutely need to, and when we choose to do that we ensure that it is accessed securely & safely. 


## Pillars of Dashboard Legal Data Residency & Retrieval

### Not storing sensitive information (like Emails & Documents)
You have existing systems for your emails + documents, so there is no need for us to store this information. We surface this data in our organized interface to authenticated users if they have access to view this information.

We have tight two-way integrations with your Email + DMS providers to ensure that those systems maintain the single source of truth of your data.


### Access on behalf of users
When a user links an email or DMS integration, they authenticate with that system and Dashboard Legal surfaces information from those systems in our UI.

This means that a user will only ever be able to see their own emails and documents that they already have access to in those systems.

In the event of a service account integration that has broader permissions than just 1 user account, this integration is paired with our SSO authentication to ensure proper data access.

For the various options of integration, please see the [Email Integration](../email/configuring-integrations) and [DMS Integration](../documents/imanage) documentation.

### User access at various organizational levels
Not all data is stored in external Email & DMS systems. For example, our Chat & Checklist are proprietary Dashboard Legal features that create/utilize data securely stored in the deployment environment (either cloud or on-prem).

This data is accessible based on our built-in user access controls. Simply put, you can only see the chat & checklist data for a matter or workstream if you are given permission by that matter/workstream administrator.


## Data Residency
Use the following tables to determine where data lives and who has access.

By "DBL Staff Access", this does not mean that all DBL staff has access, but that certain authorized staff members could potentially access if there was a need, like debugging an issue.
