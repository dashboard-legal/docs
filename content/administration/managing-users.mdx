> This portion of the documentation is written for organization Owners and Admins. These users will have an "Organization Settings" tab in the header dropdown, below the "Account" tab.

## User Roles
There are 3 types of user roles in your organization:
- **Owner** - Can manage all aspects of the organization
- **Admin** - Has access to all organization settings besides billing
- **Member** - Can create & manage boards, but cannot manage organization settings

## Inviting & Managing Users
Owners and Admins can manage existing users and invite new ones in the [user management section](https://app.dashboardlegal.com/x/settings/users/) of the organization settings.

### Sending Invites
You may invite a new user into the organization by clicking the "Invite" button on the [user management page](https://app.dashboardlegal.com/x/settings/users/).

After entering the email and pressing "Invite", the user will receive an email invite with a link to sign up. They will need to sign up with the exact email that they were invited under.

Pending invites will show up in the "Invites" section of this page, as well as the organization signup link. If the newly invited user cannot locate their invite email, you may send them the organization signup link manually.

### Administering Users
All users which accept an invite will become a Member of the organization. If you would like for them to also be able to manage the organization, you may change their user role to Admin.

Users may be deactivated by pressing the "Deactivate" button in the Users section. Deactivated users cannot log into their Dashboard Legal account.

## Matter & Workstream Administration
The organization user management page governs which users have access to the organization. However, matter and workstream boards have their own role-based access controls, with a similar role structure.

Any member of the organization can create a new matter board, and they become the Owner of that board. They can then manage the settings of that matter board, add other Members or Admins, or make the board public to all Members of the organization.

In the same manner, workstream boards have an Owner. This Owner does not need to be the same user as the Owner for the matter board.

With flexible role-based access controls at the Organization, Matter, and Workstream levels, you may set up Dashboard Legal in the way that makes the most sense for your team.
