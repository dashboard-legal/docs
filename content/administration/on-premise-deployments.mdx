title: On-Premise Deployments
description: Dashboard Legal is available to deploy on your own infrastructure via the Reynen Court Platform.
---

Besides the multi-tenant & private-tenant deployments that Dashboard Legal provides in it's own cloud infrastructure, customers can choose to deploy our technology in their own on-premise hosted infrastructure.

This is done through a partner called [Reynen Court](https://reynencourt.com). For those new to Reynen Court, think of it like an app store for legal technology. Both Dashboard Legal and it's customer law firms integrate with the Reynen Court platform, which enables Dashboard Legal to release new versions of it's technology for law firms to deploy on their own servers (or private cloud).

To learn more about Reynen Court, please read about the [platform](https://reynencourt.com/platform), [benefits](https://reynencourt.com/benefits), and [company](https://reynencourt.com/about) on their website.


## About Reynen Court Deployments
- Dashboard Legal deploys a kubernetes helm chart to the Reynen Court (RC) platform.
- After security testing & smoke testing, it becomes available to partner law firms.
- Law firms host their own version of application, which the Dashboard Legal team does not have access to.
- Dashboard Legal does provide support for RC-deployed applications, but require collaboration from the law firm's IT staff to debug any issues.
- Dashboard Legal application functionality relies on third-party [email integrations](../email/intro/#currently-supported-integrations) and [document integrations](../documents/intro/#currently-supported-integrations), which are not deployed as part of the Dashboard Legal stack, and thus still need to be integrated. These integrations could be cloud-based, or also deployed on-premise in some cases.


## Getting Started
If you are new to Reynen Court, please [book a demo](https://reynencourt.com/contact) to get acquainted with their team.

If you are an existing Reynen Court consortium members, please look for the Dashboard Legal application in the [solutions store](https://docs.rcplatform.io/docs/reynen-court-store).


## Deployment Guide

### rcspec File
The following application configuration options are required/available.

| Variable      | Required | Description |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------|
| num_app_replicas | Yes | The number of application pods to launch. |
| database_size_gb | Yes | The number of gigabytes to reserve for database storage. |
| database_backups_size_gb | Yes | The number of gigabytes to reserve for database backups. |
| file_storage_size_gb | Yes | The number of gigabytes to reserve for files. |
| azuread_oauth2_key | No | Azure AD OAuth2.0 Key. Required for Outlook integration. |
| azuread_oauth2_secret | No | Azure AD OAuth2.0 Secret. Required for Outlook integration. |
| smtp_host | No | SMTP Host. Required to send emails such as password reset. |
| smtp_port | No | SMTP Port |
| smtp_username | No | SMTP User |
| smtp_password | No | SMTP Password |
| smtp_use_tls | No | Use TLS over SSL for SMTP connection |

Please note that the azure key/secret are required to use the [o365 Outlook Integration](../email/intro/#currently-supported-integrations).

The SMTP credentials are used only for certain application-initiated emails like password reset. The user emails will be managed by the selected email integration provider. It is recommended to include SMTP credentials for the environment if your users are logging in with username/password.

### Creating the Organization
The IT admin at the law firm should sign up at "/accounts/signup/" on the host that is created on the RC platform. After signing up, they can then manage the organization [security settings](./security-settings) and [invite other users](./managing-users).

### Configuring Integrations
To set up SSO, please follow [this guide](./security-settings/#single-sign-on). Please keep in mind that invited users should visit the organization-specific login/register page to sign in with SSO.

If you are using the o365 Outlook email integration, there is no additional configuration necessary. Invited users will log in via oauth2 to link their email account.

The default document integration is set to Dashboard Legal. For on-premise deployments, the documents are stored on-premise using a Minio container. To set up an iManage DMS integration, please follow [this guide](../documents/imanage). The decision to use Dashboard Legal's DMS on your own servers or connecting a third-party DMS will have implications on infrastructure requirements.


## Infrastructure Sizing 

When deploying the Dashboard Legal application on your own infrastructure, please allocate the following recommended infrastructure sizes, based on your organization size.

Please keep in mind that the Minio container stores certain images used in the application (like user avatars), and documents if you are using the DBL in-house DMS. There will always be a need for some storage space (for the avatars), but if you are using the DBL DMS you will need to size it based on your intended document use.


| Deployment    | Resource | Requirement |
| ----------    | -------- | ----------- |
| Small (less than 20 users) | vCPU   | 1                           |
|                            | Memory | Web 1Gi, Hasura 1Gi         |
|                            | Disc   | Postgres 8Gi, Minio 4Gi\*   |
| Medium (20 - 50 users)     | vCPU   | 2                           |
|                            | Memory | Web 2Gi, Hasura 2Gi         |
|                            | Disc   | Postgres 16Gi, Minio 8Gi\*  |
| Large (50+ users)          | vCPU   | 4                           |
|                            | Memory | Web 4Gi, Hasura 4Gi         |
|                            | Disc   | Postgres 64Gi, Minio 16Gi\* |

\* If using the DBL DMS, add estimated size of documents stored
