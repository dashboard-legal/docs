## How to configure a DMS integration

If you wish to use Dashboard Legal's DMS (documents are hosted in AWS s3), you don't need to take any action. This is the default configuration for all organizations.

If you would like to use the iManage Cloud integration, please read the [iManage guide](./imanage/). You'll be delighted that you can configure the iManage integration in less than 30 seconds.


## How to log into your DMS

If your organization has a DMS configured, you will not be able to access any DMS documents from Dashboard Legal until you log into your DMS. You can do this from your [integrations settings](https://app.dashboardlegal.com/x/account/integrations/) and your should only have to do this once.


## How to Manage Matters

DMS matters are mapped to Dashboard Legal Workstream boards. In the settings for the workstream board, board admins/owners will find a dropdown to select the DMS matter for that workstream. If you are using the DBL DMS, there's no configuration necessary.

Once a matter is linked to a workstream board, those matter documents are visible in the board. They are 2-way synced, which means you can view + upload the same documents from either Dashboard Legal, or your DMS.

## How to Browse Documents

In each workstream's documents page, you'll find recent documents, as well as the folder structure for the matter. You may create a folder or choose to upload a document at any level of the folder hierarchy.

When clicking on a document, you will see a preview (if it's a supported document type), and have the option to download the document locally. If there are multiple versions of the same document, you will be able to see details on each version and also toggle between them.


## How to Upload Documents

Uploading documents is possible from the following places:
- workstream documents page
- workstream documents subfolder
- email attachment

When uploading a document, you will need to select the workstream and folder, and select if it's a new document or an existing one. If it is an existing document, the version will be incremented automatically.

Each document version can be uploaded with an optional comment. This comment is visible in the versions list, as well as the document owner and date it was updated.


## How to Search Documents

You may search documents by name within a particular workstream, or globally by using the search in the top navbar of Dashboard Legal.

At the moment, you will only be able to view documents that are in matters linked to Dashboard Legal Workstreams.
