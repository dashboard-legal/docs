> Dashboard Legal is designed to integrate with multiple possible email providers.
> At the moment, the only one that is availble if Microsoft Outlook, although Gmail is coming soon!


## Set up your email integration

1. Go to your [email settings](https://app.dashboardlegal.com/x/account/email/).
2. Select the email provider of your choice and log in with your credentials for that email provider, then accept the permissions that Dashboard Legal requires to manage your email.

   <ExpansionPanel title="Email Integration Security">
   	- Dashboard Legal treats the security of your data as it's highest priority.
   	- We do not store your emails/attachments/events/contacts on our servers.
   	- We explicitly ask for your permission to hit Outlook/Gmail APIs on your behalf.
   	- You can opt out of our email integration at any time.
   </ExpansionPanel>

3. Upon successful authentication, you will be able to manage your email in your [main inbox](https://app.dashboardlegal.com/x/mail/).


## Admin approval

Some Microsoft/Google organizations will require admin approval to use Dashboard Legal.

If you get a message that says you need admin approval, please follow [this guide](../email/get-admin-approval/) to learn how to request it.


## Disconnect & Refresh

If you would like to link a different email account, you may press "Disconnect" and link a different account.

If you are for some reason not able to see any of your emails, press the "Refresh Permissions" button to re-connect your email integration.
