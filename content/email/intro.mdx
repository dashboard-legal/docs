## How it works

Dashboard Email works with your existing email provider, and provides you workflow & collaboration features on top of your existing email content.

You can connect your email account, and the state of your emails in Dashboard Legal mirrors that of Outlook or Gmail (when you mark an email as read in Dashboard Legal, that status is also updated in your email provider)

## Email security

- Dashboard Legal treats the security of your data as it's highest priority.
- We do not store your emails/attachments/events/contacts on our servers.
- We explicitly ask for your permission to hit Outlook/Gmail APIs on your behalf.
- You can opt out of our email integration at any time.

## Email rules

One of the core features of Dashboard Legal is simple but configurable client & workstream email rules.

You can configure email rules to easily display email communications between you and contacts at your clients.


## Email inboxes

As a Dashboard Legal user, you have access to the following inboxes:

- **Inbox** - All of your emails. If an email matches your client/workstream email rules, that will be visualized indicated in the client color.
- **Sent** - All of your sent emails. They will also be visualized in the client color.
- **Client** - All of your emails that match a particular client's email rules. These inboxes are easily accessed via your left sidebar.
