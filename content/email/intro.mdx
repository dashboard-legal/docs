## How it works

Dashboard Legal works with your existing email provider, and provides you workflow & collaboration features on top of your existing email content.

You can connect your email account, and the state of your emails in Dashboard Legal mirrors that of Outlook or Gmail (when you mark an email as read in Dashboard Legal, that status is also updated in your email provider)


## Email integrations

Dashboard Legal is designed to supplement your existing email account, and can be integrated with one of several providers.

If your email provider is not currently supported but you can't wait to try out Dashboard Legal, please reach out to us with your technical specifications and we will get you on board as quick as we can.

## Email security

Dashboard Legal treats the security of your data as it's highest priority. You can read all about our email security practices [here](./email-security).


## Email rules

One of the core features of Dashboard Legal is simple but configurable client & workstream email rules.
You can configure email rules to easily segment email communications between you and internal and external stakeholders.

When you configure email rules, you will be able to visualize a client's emails in a client's dedicated inbox (more on that below). Additionally, in your main inbox you will be able to see each email tagged with the client inbox if it applies to that email.


## Your inboxes

As a Dashboard Legal user, you have access to the following inboxes:
- **Inbox** - All of your emails. If an email matches your client/workstream email rules, that will be visualized indicated in the client color.
- **Sent** - All of your sent emails. They will also be visualized in the client color.
- **Client** - All of your emails that match a particular client's email rules. These inboxes are easily accessed via your left sidebar.
