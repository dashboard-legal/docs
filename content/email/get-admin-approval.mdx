## Microsoft Outlook
### Requesting access to use Dashboard Legal

When integrating your Outlook account, you may see a screen like the one below. This means that your Microsoft organization requires you to request permissions from an administrator in order to use Dashboard Legal. 

<div style="max-width:400px;">

</div>

To get access:
1. Use the form to write a message to your admin, justifying your use of Dashboard Legal.
2. You will receive an email that the request is sent.
3. When your request is approved, you will receive an email notifying you.
4. You may then go to [link your email](./link-your-email) and your Outlook integration will be up and running.

#### Granting access

> If you are an administrator for a Microsoft account, you may get a request from a colleague to use Dashboard Legal. Please read our [email security section](./intro#email-security) and follow the below steps to approve use of Dashboard Legal.

1. Go to the [Admin Consents Review](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/StartboardApplicationsMenuBlade/AccessRequests/menuId/) page in the Azure Portal.
2. Click on the request to access Dashboard Legal.
3. Review the permissions, and accept the request.
4. Additional users in your organization will be able to access Dashboard Legal without having to request again, unless you restrict access to the application.

### Admin User Required

If you see the below screen, that means that your Microsoft organization does not allow non-admins to use third-party applications.

</div>

In order to get access:
1. Find out who your Microsoft administrator is.
2. Go to your [organization settings](https://app.dashboardlegal.com/x/settings/users/) and invite them to use Dashboard Legal.
3. Reach out to them and have them [register](https://app.dashboardlegal.com/accounts/signup/), then [link their email](https://app.dashboardlegal.com/x/account/email/).
4. They can then authorize Dashboard Legal for their account, and also grant access to the rest of the users in your Microsoft organization.
5. You may now both enjoy a streamlined email workflow together :)
